# Scapy
A Computer Security project that uses scapy and python to perform Reconnaissance on IoT devices

Scapy is a Python program that enables the user to send, sniff and dissect and forge network packets

The dataset used is Foscam IP Cameras

However, the program as in general works with any dataset containing IP addresses 

By analysing the results, one can discover vulnerabilities in these devices such as type of OS being used, Port 80 being open that 
most attackers exploit to conduct Man In The Middle Attack, etc.
